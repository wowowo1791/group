## Assignment 5: Group Events

### Project Summary

For this project, we were tasked with developing various online ordering systems for different scenarios, where each scenario involved creating a menu of items that users could add to their shopping cart. We focused on applying DOM manipulation using JavaScript, working with arrays, and utilizing loops to handle the interactions between users and the items they select. The scenarios included building an online bookstore, a restaurant menu, an amusement park ticket system, and a flower shop.

Each webpage featured core elements such as a list of available items (whether books, flowers, or foods), a shopping cart to track selections, and functionality to allow users to remove the last item they added. The project allowed us to practice creating interactive elements that enhance user experience, while also refining our understanding of JavaScript logic for dynamic content generation and manipulation. We chose this project to further develop our skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation while working as a team to build cohesive, functional web applications.

### Key Takeaways

Understanding of why we are doing this project

### Core Webpages

The project consists of several core webpages, each focused on a different scenario. Below is a brief description of each page and its functionality:

#### Online Bookstore
The **Online Bookstore** page allows customers to browse a selection of books available for purchase, including *Hop on Pop*, *Fox in Socks*, *The Cat in the Hat*, and *A Fly Went By*. Customers can add books to their cart by clicking a "+" button next to each book. The page displays a shopping cart with the selected books, and users can remove the last added book by clicking the "-" button. A "No books in cart" message is displayed when the cart is empty.

#### Restaurant Menu
The **Restaurant Menu** page is for a local restaurant that sells hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries, and onion rings. Customers can add items to their cart by clicking a "+" button next to each menu item. The cart is updated in real time, and users can remove the last item added by clicking a "-" button. If no items are in the cart, the page displays a message indicating that the cart is empty.

#### Flower Shop
The **Flower Shop** page showcases available flowers, including Roses, Tulips, Daisies, and Lilies. Customers can add these flowers to their cart by clicking the "+" button next to each flower. The cart dynamically updates to reflect the selected items. Users can remove the last flower added to the cart by clicking the "-" button. If the cart is empty, a message is displayed to let users know that no flowers are currently in their cart.
