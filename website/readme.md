### Core Webpages

As the project’s Architect, I ensured structural consistency and helped establish the layout and navigation of our website. Our application includes six core pages, each contributing unique content and interactivity to the overall experience.

The Home Page, developed by Karyn, introduces users to the theme of space exploration. It welcomes users with a clean layout, creative nav bar, and log in button. I (Daniel) created the Login Page, which supports login, logout, and user switching through local Storage, enabling users to interact with personalized content across the site.

Karyn also developed the Sun Page, which provides interesting information about the Sun and features a real-time API integration to enhance its educational value. Anthony was responsible for the Jupiter and Saturn pages, which allow users to view, add, edit, and delete planet facts. These features demonstrate CRUD functionality using localStorage, offering an interactive way to learn and engage with planetary data.

Finally, I built the Matching Game page, where users can test their knowledge through a flashcard-style matching activity. This page includes full CRUD functionality, enabling users to create, update, and delete flashcards stored locally in the browser.

### Design Choices & Local Storage Design

Our website is Space themed so the background is black and dark like outerspace. And the letters are white and bright like stars. We took inspiration form the NASA website and images that have been captured over the decades of space travel. Karyn also made the decision to replace the normal cursor icon with the style "cursor: crosshair", to mimic the look of precise positioning and calculating of a specific spot in physical space. And all of the links (a tags) transition the cursor to look like an arrow with a small version of the crosshair next to it ("cursor: copy").
