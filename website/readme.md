### Key Takeaways

What have you learned or practiced during this semester that aided in the completion of your project.

### Core Webpages

As the project’s Architect, I ensured structural consistency and helped establish the layout and navigation of our website. Our application includes six core pages, each contributing unique content and interactivity to the overall experience.

The Home Page, developed by Karyn, introduces users to the theme of space exploration. It welcomes users with a clean layout and a custom message for those who are logged in. I (Daniel) created the Login Page, which supports login, logout, and user switching through localStorage, enabling users to interact with personalized content across the site.

Karyn also developed the Sun Page, which provides interesting information about the Sun and features a real-time API integration to enhance its educational value. Anthony was responsible for the Mars and Venus pages, which allow users to view, add, edit, and delete planet facts. These features demonstrate CRUD functionality using localStorage, offering an interactive way to learn and engage with planetary data.

Finally, I built the Matching Game page, where users can test their knowledge through a flashcard-style matching activity. This page includes full CRUD functionality, enabling users to create, update, and delete flashcards stored locally in the browser.
