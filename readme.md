### Key Takeaways

Understanding of why we are doing this project

### Core Webpages
#### Online Bookstore Page

The Online Bookstore Page serves as the main interface for users to browse through a selection of available books and interact with their shopping cart. It displays a range of books, including popular titles like Hop on Pop, Fox in Socks, The Cat in the Hat, and A Fly Went By, each with an option to add them to the cart. Users can view the contents of their shopping cart, which shows the books they have selected. Additionally, there is a button available that allows users to remove the last added book from the cart.

##### Features

The available books include popular titles such as Hop on Pop, Fox in Socks, The Cat in the Hat, and A Fly Went By, providing a variety of choices for users to explore.

The shopping cart is conveniently displayed below the list of books. It shows the titles that the user has added, allowing them to review their selections before proceeding with any further actions. The cart automatically updates as users add or remove books.
